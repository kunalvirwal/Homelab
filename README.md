# Homelab

This repository contains docker composes, ansible playbooks, setup instructions and any relevant configuration files, for all self-hosted services running in my homelab.
Future self-hosted services and improvements will be continuously added to this repository as the homelab evolves.
The setup is designed to be modular and easy to extend and properly monitored. Instructions to deploy and manage each component are included within the respective compose and configuration files.
